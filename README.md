This little Jupyter notebook project is aimed at resizing the .jpg and .png formats.
It is plain simple and does only require the installation of Jupyter Notebooks and Python libraries,
for instance, you can use the full-package distributive of Python, called Anaconda (2 for Python 2.7 and 3 for Python 3..)
It comes with many useful packages, such as Jupyter Notebooks, Spyder and many more, and
you can download it from the official site: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
Installation files are at the bottom of the page.


To use the notebook:

1. Put it inside the folder with the pictures you would like to resize
2. Call your Jupyter notebooks application and open the notebook (png_resize.ipynb)
3. Enter the path to the picture under the name (img_path) (You must be in the same folder!)
4. Enter the width and height of the new img (in pixels, hence -> integer, int)
5. Enter the name of the new file in img.save("outputname.png");
6. The image is now saved in the same directory as the original image. 

You can try the code on the test image that comes together with this notebook!

Happy coding!
